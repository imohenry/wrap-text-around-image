        <p></p>
        <!--Loid start-->
        <p>
          Loid Forger: The adoptive father of Anya Forger, who works undercover
          as a psychiatrist working in Ostania, while he secretly works as a
          spy.
          <br />
        </p>
        <!--Loid End-->

        <p>
          <!--Yor start-->
          Yor Forger: The mother of the family that works as a civil servant at
          Berlint City Hall while also working for an unknown assassin
          organization by the code name "Thorn Princess".
        </p>
        <!--Yor End-->
        <br />

        <!--Anya start-->
        <p>
          Anya Forger: The adopted daughter of Loid Forger and Yor Forger, who
          doesn't know she isn't Loid's biological daughter. She was used as an
          experiment by the Ostanian government that gave her the ability to
          read minds. She ended up in an orphanage multiple times until
          eventually, she met Loid who adopted her.

          <!--Bond Start-->
          Bond Forger: The pet of the family, much like Anya he too was used for
          experimentation by the Ostanian government and eventually found his
          way into the black market where he was sold to be a bomb dog. He would
          eventually meet Anya due to his precognition ability given to him from
          the experiments.
